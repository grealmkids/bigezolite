- **Balance due**: Computed field `(total_fees_due - amount_paid)`
- **Due date**: Payment deadline
- **RSVP number**: School accountant's mobile money number

### Fees Modal (Per Student)
Opens when clicking student row, shows:

1. **Add New Term Record Form**
   - Term selector (1, 2, 3)
   - Year input
   - Total fees due
   - Due date picker
   - RSVP number (pre-filled from school settings)
   - "Add" button

2. **Payment History Table**
   Columns: Term/Year, Fee (fees_to_track name), Amount Paid, Balance, Due Date, Actions
   - Fee column shows the configured fee name for the record (e.g., ‚ÄúSports fees‚Äù); defaults to ‚ÄúSchool Fees‚Äù for legacy records or when missing
   
   **Actions per row:**
   - **Edit button**: Enter edit mode, modify amount paid
   - **üìß Send Reminder button**: Opens reminder preview modal (see structure below)

### Fees Status Filtering & Per-Term View (NEW)
- Activating the Fees Status filter switches the list to one row per student per term.
- Status rules:
  - Paid: balance ‚â§ 0
  - Partially Paid: balance > 0 and amount_paid > 0
  - Defaulter: balance > 0 (includes Partially Paid)
- Client-side per-term filtering ensures Paid never appears under other filters; Defaulter includes all outstanding balances.
- Responsive actions: full buttons on large screens, icon-only on small screens for quick actions (refresh, download).

- Widened columns for Term, Year, and Balance to prevent wrapping.
- Status-themed header stamp (Paid/Partially Paid/Defaulter) and color-coded balance.
- Without filter: generates the Student List PDF.

#### 3. Send Bulk SMS
- **Page**: Communications (Bulk SMS)
- **Filters**:
  - Recipient class (all or specific)
  - Custom message
- **Process**:
  1. Query students by filter

1. Click "Send Reminder" button on fee record
2. Preview modal opens automatically with:
   - Student name
   - Parent phone number
   - **Pre-filled, editable message**:
     ```

### Bulk Fees Reminders

**Access**: Sidenav ‚Üí "Bulk Fees Reminders"

**Page Layout**: Settings Form ‚Üí Preview Analytics ‚Üí Send

#### Step 1: Configure Campaign Settings
Form fields:
- **üí∞ Minimum Balance Threshold** (default: 1000 UGX)
  - Only students with balance ‚â• this amount receive reminder
- **üìÖ Payment Deadline** (optional)
  - If set: all reminders use this deadline
  - If empty: each reminder uses student's individual `due_date`
- **üéì Filter by Class** (dropdown)
  - "All Students" or specific class
  - Classes populated from school type
- **üë§ Filter by Student Status** (dropdown)
  - All Statuses, Active, Inactive, Expelled, Alumni, Suspended, Sick

**Button**: Blue "üëÅÔ∏è Preview Campaign" button

#### Step 2: Preview Analytics (Replaces Form)
Displays:

1. **üìä Analytics Cards Grid**
   - **Recipients**: Count of students matching criteria
   - **Total Balance**: Sum of all outstanding balances
  - **Estimated Cost**: Total SMS cost computed as recipients √ó (costPerSms √ó smsUnits). `costPerSms` is configurable via the server env var `COST_PER_SMS` (or returned by a runtime config endpoint) and `smsUnits` = ceil(message.length / 160).
   - **Message Length**: Character count and SMS units

2. **üìù Sample Message Box**
   - Shows generated message using first student's data
   - Format identical to individual reminders
   - White background, monospace font, blue left border

3. **üë• Recipients Table**
   - Shows first 10 recipients
   - Columns: Student Name, Phone, Balance
   - Note if more than 10: "...and X more"

4. **Action Buttons** (bottom)
   - **"‚Üê Back to Settings"** (Dark Grey #4b5563) - Returns to form without sending
   - **"üìß Send Fees Reminders"** (Green gradient) - Sends to all recipients

#### Step 3: Send Process
- Validates SMS balance
- Generates personalized message for each student
- Sends SMS to all matching students
- Updates SMS account balance
- Logs transaction
- Shows success message with count
- Returns to settings form

**Backend Processing**:
```sql
-- Query students with balance >= threshold
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, s.parent_phone_sms,
       COALESCE(SUM(f.balance_due), 0) as balance,
       COALESCE(SUM(f.amount_paid), 0) as amount_paid,
       MIN(f.due_date) as earliest_due_date
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN fees_records f ON s.student_id = f.student_id
WHERE s.school_id = $1
  [AND s.class_name = $2]  -- if class filter
  [AND s.student_status = $3]  -- if status filter
GROUP BY s.student_id
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(f.balance_due), 0) >= $threshold
```

### Character Estimation
- **Typical message**: 160-176 characters
- **90-95% of messages**: 1 SMS unit (‚â§ 160 chars)
- **5-10% of messages**: 2 SMS units (161-306 chars)
  - Occurs with longer names or larger amounts

### SMS Cost Calculation
- **Cost per SMS**: Determined by the server `costPerSms` configuration (default via the `COST_PER_SMS` env var). Client UIs display prices computed as numberOfSms √ó costPerSms; the preview and send flows include SMS fragmentation by computing smsUnits = ceil(message.length / 160).
- **Balance check**: Before any send operation the system verifies provider balance ‚â• recipients √ó (costPerSms √ó smsUnits).
- **Error handling**: Returns 402 if insufficient balance
- **Transaction logging**: All sends recorded in `sms_transactions`

## Subscription Management

### Subscription Packages
Located at: **Dashboard ‚Üí "Buy SMS" Card ‚Üí "Subscribe" Link**

**Available Packages**:
1. **Silver - 100 SMS**: 35,000 UGX
2. **Gold - 300 SMS**: 100,000 UGX
3. **Platinum - 1000 SMS**: 300,000 UGX

### Pay-As-You-Go (Credits)
- The system supports Pay‚ÄëAs‚ÄëYou‚ÄëGo SMS purchases (credits). Prices and credit calculations use the server `costPerSms` configuration. The frontend computes displayed package prices as `numberOfSms √ó costPerSms`.
- For runtime updates without rebuilding the frontend, the client can fetch the current `costPerSms` from the runtime endpoint `GET /api/v1/config/sms` so price changes made in server environment variables take effect immediately.

### Order Process
1. User selects package
2. Order created in `orders` table
3. Status: "pending"
4. School admin receives notification with:
   - School name
   - Contact phone
   - Package details
   - Order tracking ID
5. Admin manually activates after payment confirmation

### Account Status Workflow
```
New School ‚Üí Dormant (operations allowed)
    ‚Üì
Subscribe ‚Üí Active (full access, SMS enabled)
    ‚Üì
Payment Late ‚Üí Suspended (operations blocked)
    ‚Üì
Renew ‚Üí Active
```

### Subscription Middleware
- Checks `account_status` on protected routes
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Only "Suspended" blocks operations
- "Dormant" and "Active" allow access

## Recent Updates (October 2025)

### ‚úÖ Per-Term Fees View & Exports
- Fees status filter shows per-student-per-term rows with client-side filtering for accuracy.
- Fees modal now displays ‚ÄúFee‚Äù (from fees_to_track) instead of ‚ÄúTotal Due‚Äù, with default ‚ÄúSchool Fees‚Äù.
- Updated Fees Details PDF with per-term rows, widened columns (Term/Year/Balance), themed stamp, and formatted amounts.

### ‚úÖ Fees to Track Module
- New page and APIs to define fee items per school (name, total_due, term, year, class/all, due_date).
- Automatically applies to matching students by creating fees_records (with RSVP number); updates propagate to related records; deletes cascade.
- Inline edit/delete in the Fees to Track list.
- Sidenav entry and route: `/fees-to-track`.

### ‚úÖ Fees Reminder System
- Individual reminder with editable preview modal
- Single SMS supports schoolId override to ensure correct school context (fixes cross-school ‚Äústudent not found‚Äù)
- Message format updated to include fee name and end-tag with school and term/year
- Bulk reminders with analytics preview
- Proper currency formatting (commas, no decimals)
- Date format: DD-MMM-YYYY
- Balance threshold filtering
- Class and status filtering
- Optional custom deadline override
- SMS cost calculation and validation

### ‚úÖ UI/UX Improvements
- Settings ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Send flow for bulk reminders
- Analytics cards use a 2-column layout (icon left, label/value right)
- Dark grey "Back to Settings" button
- Green gradient "Send" button
- Mobile-responsive preview cards
- Character counter and SMS units
- Real-time balance validation
- Success/error snackbar standardization

### ‚úÖ Data Accuracy
- Fixed currency formatting bug (concatenation issue)
- Proper aggregation of total paid/balance from all records
- Correct school_id data isolation
- Database column name fixes (balance_due, student_status)

---

### ‚úÖ Hotfixes & Stability Improvements (Oct 27, 2025)
- Fixed SQL placeholder/parameter mismatch that caused Postgres errors like "bind message supplies X parameters, but prepared statement '' requires Y" by reworking the SQL builder to assemble ordered WHERE clauses and params and replacing $Y/$T tokens with proper $n placeholders.
- Added audit logs for preview/send flows that print the highest $ placeholder and the params length; the handlers now fail-fast with a clear diagnostic when mismatches occur to make debugging trivial.
- Corrected Bulk Fees Reminders preview to use the school's SMS provider balance (via per-school credentials) as `totalBalance` instead of student fee balances.
- Updated Estimated Cost calculation to compute per-recipient cost including SMS fragmentation: estimatedCost = recipients √ó (costPerSms √ó smsUnits), where smsUnits = Math.max(1, ceil(message.length / 160)).
- Replaced fragile string-replacement of student_terms tokens ($Y/$T) with global placeholder insertion so no leftover `$` tokens remain in SQL (resolves syntax errors near '$').
- Implemented deterministic clause-based SQL builder for preview and send flows to ensure placeholders and params stay aligned across filter combinations.
- Added unit tests covering the communication SQL builder to prevent regressions (`test/communication.service.test.ts`).
- Improved logging in bulk flows to output final SQL and params for easier debugging in staging/production.

### ‚úÖ Client & UI Fixes
- On the login page load and on logout, client-side clearing now removes app data from `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, attempts to clear Cache Storage and unregister service workers, and performs best-effort cookie clearing to reduce stale data and privacy leakage.
- Bulk Fees preview icons replaced with monochrome inline SVGs and `.mono-icon` CSS for consistent sizing and color with the side-nav.
