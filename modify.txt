but the /students table still shows students of school id 2, not the new school i have created of id 4.why? is the table not querying students afresh? it should.when the /students url is loaded, not to use cache or stored values

maybe we change the url http://localhost:4200/students to explicitly  show the school id, and then query the students' data for that particular school id. i believe that will help. let us be explicit.


currently the urljust seems to be fetching all student rows regardless the chosen school. this is wrong
