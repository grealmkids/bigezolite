i want B) Show per-student-per-term rows in the UI and PDF.
but amnow thinking of the actual usecase: schools dont only collect school fees, but also other fees like sports fees, etc.  they want to be able to for instance add a new fee to track (give it a name, total_due,term,year(default current year), class (either all or choose from dropdown), due_date), so we can have this as a new table say "fees_to_track", its own sidenav option in the dashboard,and its own route with CRUD operations for the selected school. , the "fees_records" table should use foreign key from the new "fees_to_track" table, so that if the admin deletes or updates a fee to track, the corresponsing rows in  "fees_records" table are automatically deleted or updated as well. when an admin sets a new fee to track, automatically set it for each student who fits(for the selected class,term,year and of course school_id) the corresponding category of the new fee, with the default "Total Due"=total_due,"Amount Paid"=0,"Balance"=total_due, "Term/Year" and "Due Date"=due_date in the "fees_records" table. can you pull this off with deep and accurate reasoning like a team of senior developers who have the ability to accurately interprete client needs and ship the product upgrade as desired?
