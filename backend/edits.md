## Work Done

*   Identified all environment variables used by the application by searching for `process.env` in the `src` directory.
*   Compared the list of required environment variables with the existing `.env` file.
*   Added missing environment variables to the `.env` file with placeholder values.
*   Updated placeholder values in the `.env` file to be more descriptive.

## Pending Work

*   Replace placeholder values in the `.env` file with actual credentials for the following services:
    *   Firebase (`FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`)
    *   Pesapal (`PESAPAL_CONSUMER_KEY`, `PESAPAL_CONSUMER_SECRET`)
*   Generate a strong, random secret for `JWT_SECRET`.
*   Configure the `ADMIN_ACCOUNT` with a real administrator email address.
