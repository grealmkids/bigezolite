1. edit the modal for "Edit School". make it work. currently the modal functionality loads the values correctly,but the modal is not visibly appealing like anormal modal. also the select feature is not working. am seeing the district dropdown not showing,aldo the Student Count Range dropdown is not working.

2. in the modal for "Fees for " and "Add New Term Record" , let the RSVP number be the school accountant_number. add this to the columns of the school for both the new school inputs, and the "Edit School" section.
