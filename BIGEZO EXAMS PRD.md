Module: Student Assessment and Reporting (SAR) \- Update 1.3: Finalized Subject Logic & Comprehensive Reporting Version: 1.3 (Final Draft) Date: 2024-05-24 Target Audience: Senior Development Team (Backend/Frontend/GitHub Copilot)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1\. Goals and Objectives  
The primary goal is to implement a unified, multi-tenant system for managing assessment data, compliant with NCDC (LSC/P7) and customized for International schools, facilitating bulk data ingestion and generating professional reports.  
1\. Multi-Curriculum Filtering: Dynamically display and enforce Compulsory and Elective subject lists based on the school's type (school\_id) and curriculum requirements (LSC vs. P7 vs. International).  
2\. Bulk Efficiency: Support bulk mark upload via Exam Set configurations for subjects \[User Query\].  
3\. Compliance: Ensure calculations follow LSC (80/20) and P7 (40/60 variations) guidelines, including reporting on mandatory Generic Skills and Values.  
4\. Identification: Implement NIRA LIN as a scalable, optional identifier in the students table.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
2\. Core Data Model: Schema Review and Constraints  
We confirm that existing modules (Fees, Users, Schools) are not modified, except for the addition of the lin\_number to students and reliance on the existing UNIQUE(reg\_number, school\_id) constraint.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
3\. Functional Requirements: Core Logic & Compliance  
3.1. Subject Display and Filtering Logic (Addressing User Query) 🎯  
The key to handling various subjects per school type lies in combining the existing schools.school\_type with the configuration tables.  
1\. Smart Class Setup Integration (Frontend): When an Admin/Teacher attempts to create an Exam Set or input results, the initial interface must retrieve the relevant class list using the existing Smart Class Setup logic (Bigezo Feature 8).  
2\. Subject List Retrieval (Backend/API): Once school\_id and class\_level are selected:  
    ◦ The system must query config\_subjects using school\_id and school\_level.  
    ◦ LSC Schools (Secondary-LSC): The list must include all subjects flagged as Compulsory AND any subjects flagged as Elective that the school has chosen to offer for that level (S1, S2, S3, S4).  
    ◦ Primary Schools (Primary-Local): The list must include all P7 subjects configured for that school's school\_level (P7).  
    ◦ International Schools (International-Custom): The list includes all subjects customized by the school, regardless of NCDC rules, providing maximum flexibility \[Trello conversation\].  
3\. Validation: The backend logic must prevent a school Admin from attempting to submit marks for a subject that is outside the configured limits (e.g., submitting 3 electives for an S3 class).  
3.2. Admin Feature: Exam Set Definition and Auto-Assignment (Refined)  
Workflow:  
1\. Admin selects filters: school\_id, class\_level, term, year, and enters set\_name (e.g., "Mid Term Exams"). This creates a record in config\_exam\_sets.  
2\. The Admin defines the assessment components for chosen subjects (e.g., for Physics S3: Paper 1, Paper 2, Project) in config\_assessment\_elements.  
3\. Auto-Assignment Logic: The system performs an internal transaction:  
    ◦ Find all student\_ids belonging to the selected class\_level and school\_id.  
    ◦ For each student, identify their unique subject load (Compulsory \+ their specific Electives).  
    ◦ Insert a placeholder record into results\_exam\_entries for every required subject/exam set combination. This automatically applies the exam set to all students in the class \[User Request\].  
4.3. Bulk Mark Upload (Bulk Ingestion Service) 📤  
Process:  
1\. Template Generation: The UI generates a template listing student identifiers (reg\_number or lin\_number) and the required input columns (element\_name e.g., "Physics Paper 1 Mark").  
2\. Validation: The ingestion service must perform strict checks:  
    ◦ Identifier Check: Validate that reg\_number is unique within the school\_id. If lin\_number is used and provided, validate its global uniqueness.  
    ◦ Max Score Check: Ensure submitted scores do not exceed the max\_score defined in config\_assessment\_elements.  
3\. Data Insertion: Raw scores are inserted/updated into results\_entry, linking the score back to the exam\_entry\_id (from the pre-assigned records).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
4\. Report Generation and Output (PDF & Parent Portal)  
The PDF generation engine must be adaptive, using the curriculum\_type from config\_school\_settings to dictate the report layout and content.  
4.1. LSC Report Content (S1-S4)  
The report must reflect the competency-based curriculum requirements:  
• Assessment Breakdown: Display the Formative Score (CA contribution, typically 20%) and the End-of-Term/Summative Score (typically 80%) clearly per subject, mirroring the required assessment reporting modality.  
• Grading: Display the Total Score and the corresponding Grade (using the school's configured scale: 8-level or the 5-level A-E scale).  
• Holistic Assessment: Dedicate sections (based on data from reports\_holistic\_feedback) to reflect achievement in the non-scored areas:  
    ◦ Generic Skills: Display ratings/comments on skills like Critical thinking, Cooperation, Creativity, and Communication.  
    ◦ Values/Attitudes: Reflect progress related to values such as Respect, Honesty, Responsibility, and Care.  
• Commentary: Include space for Teacher Comments and Head Teacher/Admin Comments.  
4.2. Primary Report Content (P1-P7)  
Primary reports must also be competence-focused, accommodating granular CA structure (e.g., P7 model where CA contributes 40%) and focusing on core skills.  
• Ability Levels: The assessment report must track the learner’s achievement covering the three main levels of ability: Knowledge, Comprehension, and Application.  
• Subject-Specific Competences: The report should accommodate display of attainment on summarized competences suggested in each P7 subject (e.g., the learner: names different bones and muscles or describes activities carried out during the holidays).  
4.3. International School Reporting  
The system must allow administrators to define report layouts, scoring computations, and grade displays entirely within the configuration tables, overriding NCDC mandates, as international school reporting is often customized \[Trello conversation, 762\].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
4.4. Student Marks Dashboard (View & Edit) 📊 NEW  
A comprehensive interface for viewing and editing all student marks in a single location:  
• Dynamic Table: Displays all students in a class with marks across all subjects in an editable table
• Smart Columns: Columns dynamically generate based on available assessment elements/subjects for the selected exam set
• Inline Editing: Teachers can click any mark cell to edit directly in the table
• Visual Indicators: Changed cells highlight in yellow to indicate unsaved modifications
• Bulk Save: Single "Save All Changes" button persists all modified marks efficiently
• Per-Student Reports: Each student row includes a quick-access button to generate individual PDF report for that specific student
• Form: Route `/marks/view-marks`, Component: `StudentMarksViewerComponent`

4.5. Quick Mark Entry (Single Mark Feature) ⚡ NEW  
A fast, focused interface for entering marks one at a time:  
• Step-by-Step Form: Cascading dropdown selection: Exam Set → Subject → Student → Assessment Element → Mark Value
• Single Entry: One mark entry per submission, ideal for quick spot checks or corrections
• Smart Filtering: Each dropdown filters based on previous selections (subjects filtered by exam set, elements filtered by subject)
• Real-Time Validation: Shows maximum score for selected element, prevents out-of-range values
• Immediate Feedback: Success notification after each save, form resets for next entry
• Route: `/marks/quick-entry`, Component: `QuickMarkEntryComponent`

4.6. Per-Student Report Generation 📄 NEW  
Individual report cards for single students with full assessment details:  
• Access Points: 
  - Directly from Student Marks Dashboard ("Report" button on each student row)
  - Direct route: `/marks/student-report/:examSetId/:studentId`
• Report Contents:
  - Student identification (name, registration number)
  - Exam set details
  - Formative (Continuous Assessment) score
  - Summative score
  - Final calculated grade letter
  - Holistic feedback text (generic skills, values, comments)
• PDF Download: "Download PDF Report" button exports formatted report for printing/archival
• Professional Layout: Print-optimized styling with clear visual hierarchy
• Route: `/marks/student-report/:examSetId/:studentId`, Component: `StudentReportComponent`
